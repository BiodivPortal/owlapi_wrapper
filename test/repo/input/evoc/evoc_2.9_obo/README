Recent Changes
--------------

For eVOC 2.9:

- Ontology changes:
    * 29 new terms have been added to the ontologies
    * The structure of eVOC Cell Type ontology was updated as the ontology was aligned and cross-referenced with OBO Cell ontology (http://obofoundry.org/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?id=cell&title=Cell%20type). In the process of re-structuring, more than half of the terms in eVOC Cell Type ontology were moved under a new parent. OBO Cell Ontology is undergoing changes, so additional structural changes and refinements can be expected to happen in eVOC Cell Type ontology in the future. eVOC Cell can now be used as a 'slim' version of CL.
     * Cross-references to UniProt/Swiss-Prot tisslist have been added to the Anatomical System, Cell Type, Pathology and Development Stage ontologies.


For eVOC 2.8:

- Ontology changes:
     * 210 new terms added 
     * close to a hundred definitions added

- The eVOC ontology system now contains three new ontology files within this directory: the Mouse and Human Developmental eVOC ontologies, as well as a Theiler Stage ontology for Mouse. The Mouse Developmental ontology represents all anatomical structures throughout the 28 Theiler stages of mouse development, whereas the Human Developmental ontology represents all anatomical structures throughout the 23 Carnegie stages of human development. The Theiler Stage ontology is a hierarchy of the Theiler stages of mouse development, categorized as embryonic, fetal or adult development. A combination of terms from the Mouse Development and Theiler Stage ontologies therefore represents an anatomical structure on the spatial and temporal level.
 
The terms in the developmental ontologies are derived from Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP) and Mouse Anatomy (MA) for mouse, and Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy (HUMAT) for human. 

The reference ontologies may be obtained from

  http://obo.sourceforge.net

Some ontology formats (GO, OBO) may be viewed in OBO-Edit, DAGedit or  COBrA. These packages can be found at:

For eVOC 2.7:

 - Ontology changes:
     * Anatomical System:
        - Added term "cecum" (with synonym "caecum").
     * Cell Type:
        - "epithelium" renamed to "epithelial cell".
        - "transitional" renamed to "transitional cell".
        - "mesothelium" renamed to "mesothelial cell".
        - "neurothelium" renamed to "neurothelial cell".
        - "retinal pigment epithelium" renamed to "retinal pigment epithelial
           cell".
        - Synonym "pigmented retinal epithelium" (of "retinal pigment epithelial
          cell") changed to "pigmented retinal epithelial cell".
     * Pathology:
        - Added term "hyperthyroidism".
        
 - 6 new cDNA libraries added:
     * NIH_MGC_262
     * Homo sapiens thyroid differential display
     * Human embryonic stem cells
     * Random primed cDNA library from Homo sapiens peripheral blood leukocytes
       mRNA
     * Homo sapiens pancreatic islet
     * Human fetal brain first-strand cDNA
     
 - 157 ORESTES cDNA libraries previously misannotated are now classified
 correctly.  These libraries, which were mapped to Pathology:normal or
 Pathology:unclassifiable, are now correctly mapped to Pathology:adenocarcinoma.


The ontologies directory 
-------------------------
There are 13 orthogonal hierarchies
 - Anatomical System  (anatomicalsystem.*)
 - Pathology  (pathology.*)
 - Developmental Stage  (developmentalstage.*)
 - Cell Type  (celltype.*)
 - Pooling  (pooling.*)
 - Associated With  (associatedwith.*)
 - Microarray Platform  (microarrayplatform.*)
 - Treatment  (treatment.*)
 - Tissue Preparation (tissuepreparation.*)
 - Experimental Technique (experimentaltechnique.*)
 - Human Development (HumanDevelopment.*)
 - Mouse Development (MouseDevelopment.*)
 - Mouse Theiler Stages (TheilerStage.*)


The annotations directory
-------------------------
Annotated cDNA libraries corresponding to eVOC v2.9 (Genbank 158 freeze), 1 file per ontology.
 - Anatomical System  (anatomicalsystem_annotations.tsv)
 - Associated With (associatedwith_annotations.tsv)
 - Cell Type  (celltype_annotations.tsv)
 - Developmental Stage  (developmentalstage_annotations.tsv)  
 - Pathology  (pathology_annotations.tsv)
 - Pooling  (pooling_annotations.tsv)
 - Associated With  (associatedwith_annotations.tsv)
 - Microarray Platform  (microarrayplatform_annotations.tsv)
 - Tissue Preparation (tissuepreparations_annotations.tsv)
 - Treatment  (treatment_annotations.tsv)

Clone libraries are listed below the ontology term to which they have been mapped.
The name [Name:] and dbEST Library ID [dbEST Library ID:] of each clone library are provided, one per line.

Associating ESTs with Clone Libraries
-------------------------------------
ESTs are generated from clone libraries, and can therefore be transitively mapped to the eVOC ontologies.
The file EST2cDNALibrary.tsv provides a  tab-separated list of clone libraries (one per line) and the associated ESTs. 


Getting more information on Clone Libraries
-------------------------------------------
If you would like to look up the dbEST Library ID you can go to the following NCBI URL, and replace "PLACEHOLDER" with the id number:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/library.cgi?ORG=Hs&LID=PLACEHOLDER

eg: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/library.cgi?ORG=Hs&LID=3205
